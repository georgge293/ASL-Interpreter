This is a full-stack web application that utilizes the user's webcam to interpret American Sign Language (ASL) gestures. It continuously checks the webcam feed to recognize hand gestures and analyze the landmark positioning on the person's hand to determine the corresponding ASL letter. The interpreted letter is then displayed in a textbox using Text to Speech for accessibility.
